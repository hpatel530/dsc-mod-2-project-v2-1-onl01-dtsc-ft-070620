    "To sell or not to sell? This becomes a loaded question when you apply it to your home and a lot of research is involved to even be in the ball park for answers. Some sell their homes because of a new opportunity in a different city, others sell due to because of a family member passing. The process can be a logical one for some, an emotional one for others or both. Whatever may be the reason, you should look to maximize your profits in any case.   \n",
